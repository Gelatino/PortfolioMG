        <h3>Director's Note</h3>
        <p>The idea of the film came about when I was thinking about people who are about to commit a crime and how they, like all of us, must doubt themselves. Not a moral doubt, like 'should I do it or not?', that's not what the topic was, but more similar to self-doubt:</p>
        <blockquote>"Can I do it? What if I get caught? Perhaps I am not good enough."</blockquote>
        <p>We all have those moments of self-doubt and in those moments when we need motivation we are so caught up believing in ourselves that we forget to think if we should do it or not.</p>
